Piastri leads Norris to McLaren one-two in China

Oscar Piastri led Lando Norris to a dominant McLaren one-two in the Chinese Grand Prix ahead of George Russell's Mercedes.

Piastri's calm, controlled victory made it two wins from two for McLaren at the start of the season following Norris' outstanding drive in the wet in Melbourne last weekend.

The Australian led from pole and lost first place only briefly in the period around the leaders' only pit stops. Piastri was rarely more than four seconds ahead of Norris but always in control.

Norris was struggling with fading brakes in the closing laps but had enough of an advantage to hold Russell at bay.

Charles Leclerc drove an outstanding race in a Ferrari with a damaged front wing, faster than team-mate Lewis Hamilton, who moved out of his way.

But the pair were disqualified after the race - for separate technical infringements - along with Alpine's Pierre Gasly.

During the race, Leclerc lost fourth place to Red Bull's Max Verstappen with four laps to go as the world champion's car found some pace in the second half of the race.

Hamilton, who took an outstanding victory in the shorter sprint race on Saturday, had resisted the team orders call for a couple of laps before letting Leclerc by and then dropped back.
