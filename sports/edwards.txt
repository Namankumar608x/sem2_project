Edwards the only candidate England should consider'


Charlotte Edwards is the only candidate England should consider when appointing a new head coach of the women's team, says former batter Lydia Greenway.

England are looking for a new coach and captain after Jon Lewis and Heather Knight were removed from their positions in the aftermath of a catastrophic 16-0 points defeat in the Women's Ashes earlier this year.

And while there are a number of contenders to replace Lewis, Greenway believes it is the "perfect time" to appoint the hugely successful Edwards.

"I played most my career with her [Edwards] and I've coached with her, and I feel like she is the only name England should be looking at


"I haven't spoken to her but I think this is the perfect time for her to come into this role.

"When the role initially came up, when Lewis took it, I think she would have wanted to get herself a little bit more experience in the head coach role and she's had that.

"I'm sure the ECB will have to go through their own processes, maybe somebody like [former Australia head coach] Matthew Mott or England A coach Jon Lewis puts their name forward, but if I were them I don't think they need to look much further."

Edwards' 20-year international career came to an end in 2016, with a decade spent as captain, and she was replaced by Knight who steered England to World Cup glory a year later.

Having moved into coaching, Edwards has led Mumbai Indians to two titles in the Women's Premier League (WPL) in India, has won The Hundred with Southern Brave and claimed five domestic trophies with Southern Vipers.

She has been appointed as Hampshire's head coach in the revamped county structure in England and Wales for the 2025 season.
