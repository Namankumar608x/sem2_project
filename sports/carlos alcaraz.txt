                                                                                                                                                                                                            World number three Carlos Alcaraz suffered a shock exit from the Miami Open, losing 5-7, 6-4, 6-3 to Belgian veteran David Goffin. Goffin, ranked 55th, capitalized on Alcaraz's struggles with unforced errors and attacked after losing the first set. The 34-year-old, who last beat Alcaraz three years ago in Astana, delivered some stunning winners, ultimately securing a memorable win at Hard Rock Stadium.
