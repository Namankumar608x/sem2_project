SRH Vs RR Highlights, IPL 2025: Ishan Kishan's Ton Helps Sunrisers Hyderabad Beat Rajasthan Royals By 44 Runs


Sunrisers Hyderabad came close to the highest score in IPL history, falling just one run short. This wasn't a surprise, given their history of dominant left-handers at Uppal. While David Warner led in the past, Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head impressed last year. On Sunday, Ishan Kishan joined the list, making a memorable debut for the franchise with a blistering century, further solidifying SRH's reputation for explosive performances by left-handed batsmen at their home ground.
