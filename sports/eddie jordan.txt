Eddie Jordan - pictures in the life of a Formula 1 icon


Ex-Formula 1 team owner Eddie Jordan passed away on Thursday in Cape Town aged 76 after a battle with cancer.

A former racer, the Irishman went on to become the owner of one of Formula 1's plucky underdogs.

Jordan helped launch the careers of many racers, including Eddie Irvine and, of course, Michael Schumacher.

One of the sport's most colourful and flamboyant characters, here is Jordan's life in pictures.


Jordan was a keen racer and competed in Formula 3 before he broke a leg in an accident at Mallory Park in 1976.

After a brief return behind the wheel, he set up his own race team after hanging up his helmet, and gave a platform for drivers such as Martin Brundle and Johnny Herbert in the junior categories such as Formula 3.
