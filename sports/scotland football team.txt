Was 'embarrassing night' just a 'bump in road' for Scotland?



Scotland let themselves down on "an embarrassing night" as they were relegated to Nations League B, said midfielder John McGinn.

Steve Clarke's side held a 1-0 lead over Greece following Thursday's first leg in Piraeus, but were outplayed and outclassed by the visitors in Sunday's return, falling to a 3-1 aggregate loss.

Giannis Konstantelias swept home the opener having been left completely unmarked in the Scotland box before 17-year-old Konstantinos Karetsas curled a second just before half-time, having also been left alone in the penalty area.

The interval was much needed for the Scots, a chance to regroup and clear scrambled heads, but they shipped a calamitous third just 13 seconds after the restart - Christos Tzolis profited after Ryan Christie gave the ball away - and from there, the result was never in doubt.

"It's an embarrassing night for us, everyone is flat in the stadium, we let ourselves down," McGinn said.

"No threat in behind, probably too easy to pick up. Greece deserved to win."
