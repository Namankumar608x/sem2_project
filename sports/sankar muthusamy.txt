In the same Basel venue where he lost the 2019 World Championships final, Anders Antonsen suffered another shocking defeat. India's Sankar Muthusamy Subramanian, ranked 64th, stunned the world No. 2 with an 18-21, 21-12, 21-5 victory in a 66-minute battle. The loss echoed Antonsen's past struggles in St. Jakobshalle, where PV Sindhu famously won her title with a dominant 21-7, 21-7 win over Nozomi Okuhara.
