Piastri secured a dominant victory at the Chinese Grand Prix, giving McLaren their first one-two finish of the season and moving just 10 points behind Norris in the standings.

Both Norris and Piastri acknowledge their competitiveness but remain committed to mutual improvement.

                <p class="card-text">Scotland‚Äôs relegation to Nations League B came after a dismal 3-1 aggregate defeat to Greece, leaving midfielder John McGinn calling it "an embarrassing night." Despite holding a 1-0 lead from the first leg, Scotland‚Äôs defense collapsed in the return match, conceding goals to Giannis Konstantelias and 17-year-old Konstantinos Karetsas, followed by a third just seconds after half-time. McGinn admitted Scotland lacked threat and Greece deserved the win. While the setback is disappointing, it may serve as a learning opportunity for Steve Clarke‚Äôs side moving forward.</p>
