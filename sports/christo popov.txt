Swiss Open: Christo Popov Outplays Li Shi Feng


Christo Popov made his first final of the season beating No.6 Li Shi Feng in straight games to earn a title shot at YONEX Swiss Open 2025 against Weng Hong Yang.

Popov hadnâ€™t taken a game off Li in two previous meetings but was dominant for the most part against the fourth seed. Li did well to climb back from 4-13 in the first game to level at 17, but once Popov edged ahead 21-19, he was in control for the remainder of the match.
