Alexander Zverev Marches On In Miami Open, Naomi Osaka Falls



Top seed Alexander Zverev overcame a slow start to defeat Australia's Jordan Thompson 7-5, 6-4, reaching the Miami Open fourth round. Trailing 4-1 in the first set, the German won eight of the next nine games. After an early exit at Indian Wells, Zverev sees an opportunity with Carlos Alcaraz out. "Jordan made it difficult, but I'm happy with my level from 1-4 onwards," he said.
