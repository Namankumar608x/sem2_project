Warner to skipper Karachi Kings in PSL



Former Australia batter David Warner will captain Karachi Kings in the forthcoming Pakistan Super League.

Warner has taken over the role from Pakistan Test captain Shan Masood for the 10th edition of the T20 franchise tournament from 11 April to 18 May.

The 38-year-old, who was left unsold in this year's Indian Premier League mega draft, is taking part in the PSL for the first time.

"We have a fantastic line-up and I'm super excited to take on the role of captain this year," Warner said.

Warner skippered Sydney Thunder to the final of the 2025 Big Bash League after Cricket Australia lifted a leadership ban last year.

In 2018, Warner had been banned from cricket for 12 months and prevented from holding leadership positions as part of his punishment for a ball-tampering scandal.

Warner played 110 T20 internationals for Australia between 2009 and 2024 scoring 3,277 runs at an average of 33.43.

The left-handed opener will also play for London Spirit in The Hundred in August.
