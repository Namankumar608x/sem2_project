'Pochettino's US compensation means imminent Spurs return unlikely'



United States head coach Mauricio Pochettino had sections of his former club's fanbase giddy with excitement last week after he declared his desire to one day return to Tottenham.

It isn't a new concept, Pochettino has previously been clear in his wish to become Spurs head coach for a second period - but the current conjecture over incumbent Ange Postecoglou's future has sharpened the issue.

The Argentine remains a hero among some of the regulars at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Joining in 2014, Pochettino led the team to second and third placed finishes in the Premier League and a Champions League final.

Photos of Pochettino sharing a coffee with Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy, that went viral on social media last week, served only to amplify affections among supporters who pine for his return.



The fact the photos are not recent, certainly not taken over the past 10 days, won't quell the fervour.

Pochettino is under pressure in his current job. With a home World Cup in 2026 just 15 months away, his US side have lost consecutive Concacaf Nations League matches in the past week - beaten by Panama and Canada.

Yet, dig deeper and you realise the prospect of the 53-year-old returning to Spurs any time soon is hugely unlikely.
